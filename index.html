    <h1>generic diseases </h1>
    <h2>definition</h2>
    <p>
        human genetic disease, any of the diseases and disorders that are caused by mutations in one or more genes of the human genome.

With the increasing ability to control infectious and nutritional diseases in developed countries, there has come the realization that genetic diseases are a major cause of disability and death. Rare, indeed, is the family that is entirely free of any known genetic disorder.
 Many thousands of different genetic disorders with defined clinical symptoms have been identified. Of the 3 to 6 percent of newborns with a recognized congenital disorder, at least half involve a predominantly genetic contribution. 
 Furthermore, genetic defects are a major known cause of pregnancy loss, and almost half of all spontaneous abortions (miscarriages) involve a chromosomally abnormal fetus. About 30 percent of all postnatal infant mortality in developed countries is due to genetic disease;
  30 percent of pediatric and 10 percent of adult hospital admissions can be traced to a predominantly genetic cause. Finally, medical investigators estimate that genetic defects—however minor—are present in at least 10 percent of all adults. Thus, these are not rare events.

   <b> Genetic diseases can present with a wide range of symptoms</b> <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/genetic_disease.com" target="_blank">open in a new broswer</a> ,
     depending on the specific condition. Some common symptoms include developmental delays, 
    <em> intellectual disability, physical abnormalities</em>, and susceptibility to certain medical conditions.
